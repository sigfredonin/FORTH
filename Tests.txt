---- INSTRUCTIONS ----

Welcome to Hunt the Wumpus! You are a hunter, looking to bag a Wumpus.

The Wumpus lives in a cave of twenty rooms, each connected by
tunnels to three other rooms, as in a dodecahedron.

There are HAZARDS!!

The Wumpus - One room has the Wumpus in it. If the Wumpus
finds you in the room with it, it will eat you and you lose.

Bottomless Pits - Two rooms have bottomless pits in them.
If you go there, you fall into the pit and lose.

Super Bats - Two other rooms have super bats in them.
If you go there, a bat grabs you and takes you to another
room, at random. This might be troublesome.

As you are hunting, you will be able to sense something of
the hazards, when you are in a room adjacent to one.

- You can smell the Wumpus, when it is nearby.
- You can feel a breeze, when there is a pit nearby
- You can hear a rustling sound, when there are bats nearby.

The Wumpus is not bothered by the hazards. It has sucker
feet, so can cling to the walls of a pit, and is too heavy
for the super bats to lift. Usually, it is asleep.

Two things wake up the Wumpus: you entering its room, or
you shooting an arrow (anywhere in the cave!). When it
wakes, it moves into an adjacent room (P=3/4) or stays
where it is (P=1/4). After that, if it is where you are
it eats you and you lose.

The computer starts you in a randomly chosen room.
Each turn you can move to an adjacent room or shoot an arrow.

You are furnished with 5 crooked arrows, which you can program
to go into 1 to 5 rooms. Starting from the room you are in,
the arrow will go from room to room provided there is a tunnel
from where it is to the next room on its list. If there is no
tunnel, the arrow bounces on the walls of the cave and moves into
an adjacent room at random, possibly the one you are in.

- If the arrow hits the Wumpus, you win.
- If the arrow hits you, you lose.
- If you run out of arrows, you lose.

When the game is over, you can start a new game.
You can choose to start over with the same configuration
as the game you just finished, that is: with you, the Wumpus,
the pits, and the bats where they started in the game you
just finished; or you can start fresh, with everything in
new places (well, probably). In any case, you get a fresh
supply of five arrows.

Good luck!
